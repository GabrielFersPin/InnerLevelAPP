**Level up your real life, not just your avatar.**

_InnerLevel_ is a gamified personal development app that transforms your everyday goals into quests, your habits into stats, and your progress into power-ups.

## 🌟 Why InnerLevel?

InnerLevel was built to solve a personal need: finding a motivational system that blends personal well-being with goal tracking using game mechanics and AI. 

It's also an opportunity to demonstrate:
- My full-stack development skills (React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Design thinking applied to user motivation
- AI integration for smart goal planning
- Data persistence and gamified UX

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to contribute or discuss collaboration!
